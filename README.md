# AMA App Development Plan

## 1. Environment and Basic Setup
- **Set up Python and Virtual Environment**: Ensure Python is installed and then set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
- **Initialize a Git repository**: Start version control from the beginning.

## 2. Backend Development
- **Install and Configure Django**: Set up the Django project and configure settings for database connection, security, and other essentials.
- **Set up PostgreSQL Database**: Install PostgreSQL and create your database schema.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication in Django, including registration, login, and user roles for different access levels.
- **Admin Panel Setup**: Utilize Django admin to create interfaces for admin users to manage application data and users.
- **API Development**: Develop REST APIs for the frontend to interact with the backend (consider using Django Rest Framework).

## 3. Frontend Development
- **Choose and Set Up a JavaScript Framework**: Set up React or Vue.js. Configure the environment and create your project structure.
- **Static Pages**: Start with basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript to layout the app, including navigation and other shared components.
- **Interactive Mapping**: Integrate Folium for simple maps and Leaflet.js for interactive mapping needs.
- **Frontend Logic for User Interaction**: Implement the functionality to interact with the maps, manage tickets, and handle user inputs.

## 4. Integration of Frontend and Backend
- **Connect Frontend to Backend APIs**: Ensure the frontend can retrieve and send data to the backend effectively.
- **User Sessions and Security**: Implement secure session management and integrate user roles into the frontend.

## 5. Testing and Debugging
- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for both backend and frontend components.
- **Integration Tests**: Test how different parts of the application work together.
- **Debugging**: Use tools like the Django debug toolbar and browser developer tools to trace and fix issues.

## 6. Deployment
- **Prepare for Deployment**: Build the production version of your frontend. Set up Gunicorn as the WSGI server for Django.
- **Containerization with Docker**: Dockerize the application to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Deploy on Heroku**: Deploy the containerized app to Heroku. Configure environment variables and add-ons like the Heroku Postgres service.

## 7. Post-Deployment
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging to keep track of the appâ€™s performance and errors.
- **User Feedback and Iteration**: After initial deployment, gather user feedback and prepare for iterative improvements based on real-world usage.
